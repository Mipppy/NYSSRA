Got some time to spare, so I guess I'll start documentation.  
# Overall goal
I was "employed" for this projects for my passion for Nordic and resume building by Bob Underwood and NYSSRA.
The end goals for the programs are:
 - Unify all of New York Nordic skiing under one set of programs.
 - Provide easy API access to all Nordic race results under these programs.
 - Update old systems that are relics of the past for accessability and ease of use.  These include the [NYSSRA website](https://nyssranordic.org/) and the [BART timing system](https://barttiming.com/).  Due to the lack of existing source code, both will have to be completely rewritten.
 - Make a functional live timing system for Nordic, as it has not been in operation in a while.

Some of the goals that will have to be accomplished as a result:
 - Creating a python wrapper and documentation for the [SRT Timing System](http://summittiming.com/), as it is exceptionally hard to find any records on it.

## LIVETIMING/
This directory contains all the files for the new timing system that is in development.  It uses the SRT Timing DLL for interfacing with the Summit Race Timers, and uses PyQt5 to render HTML files to allow the user to easily interact with the timers. 
### cpp/
This is a directory that contains the failed attempts I had at compiling the DLLs with C++.  This likely failed due to me trying to compile the 32-bit DLLS on a 64-bit Linux laptop, but neverless I moved onto python, which showed more promise somehow.  
Brief overview of the directory:
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| main.cpp | This was meant to house the main file for the timing system, but due to it failing this has broken code.  If the code looks slopply or obviously wrong, it is because this was probably my 1000th attempt, and I tried a lot of stuff.  I don't think my code was the issue, it was just me trying to compile a 32-bit Windows DLL made on XP to a 64-bit Fedora Linux Laptop |
| main.exe | The exe compiled from said broken code |
| main.exe.so | This was me trying random stuff with the compiler until something different happened |
| lib/srt_data_acquisition_dll.def | See above |
| include/ | Contains my squashed hopes and dreams of writing the timing system in C++ |
| src/ | Also contains my squashed hopes and dreams of writing the timing system in C++ | 
### python/
The **real** meat of the the LIVETIMING directory.  It runs fine with `wine` on Fedora Linux, and I don't have to mess with a compiler to get it working. 
Brief overview of the directory:
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| main.py | This will be the main file for the program.  Nothing is gets exported from it.  Currently, it is used in testing the DLL and the GUI together |
| livetiming.py | The original "main" file of the directory, which is exclusively used for testing the DLL and GUI independently.  Will probably be deleted once the project is done, and an actually testing file will be made. |
| xc_timer.py | Provides a class for interfacing with the `xc_timer_dll.dll`.  Contains a replica of some of the functions in the DLL with accurate descriptions and type handling. Use this over `srt_acquisition.py`|
| srt_acquisition.py | Provides a class for interfacing with the `srt_acquisition_dll.dll`.  This was made before I realized that `xc_timer_dll.dll` was the main DLL and the one to use, so it has pretty much no use and will likely not be used in the program. | I'm not deleting it just in case, and because I don't want to admit the hour or two I spent on it was worthless |
| announcer.py | This will have the TTS part of the system when I make it. |
| settings.py | Handles the settings, using files `bart2_settings.txt` for setting storage and `bart2_settings_defaults.txt` for the defaults so I can add a reset to defaults button.  I know there is a config library, but I had already made a settings system at that point so it would be worthless. |
| helpers.py | Contains every function that may be used in more than one file and doesn't neatly fit into other files. It also contains the function to load and use the logger, loaded with `bart2_logging.conf`.|
| render.py | This is the GUI side of the program, it deals with the rendering and cconnection of the HTML and JS. |
| srt/*, open.txt, srt_log.txt |  Files generated by the DLL containing various useful information about what it is doing.  Very useful in debugging |
